## Abstract
The emergence of COVID-19 has had a significant impact on the education field, leading to a surge in the adoption of online learning and teaching. The recent development in Virtual Reality (VR) and metaverse has witnessed an increasing number of online platforms being utilized in online education. In this study, we took a user-centered approach and conducted a series of survey and interview studies with students and teachers to understand their needs of VR for learning and teaching. Additionally, we evaluated existing online platforms that can serve as virtual classrooms to host teaching materials and support students in online learning. The comparison results together with the requirements we summarized offer valuable takeaways and guides for the future adoption and creation of virtual classrooms for VR-enhanced learning and teaching.
