# Cross-Reality Interaction and Collaboration
![Cross-Reality Interaction and Collaboration](project_pictures/Cross-Reality_Interaction_and_Collaboration.png)

## Abstract
With Virtual Reality Head-Mounted Displays (VR HMDs) establishing themselves as a potent platform for collaborative tasks, their cross-reality capability and cross-domain applicability remain largely unexplored. This study intends to assess the effectiveness of cross-reality collaboration systems using a VR HMD and a desktop PC across three disparate sectors: museum visiting, chemical education, and assisted rehabilitation. The systems were designed to support social interactions and scenario-specific collaborative tasks. Evaluation of the systems showed above-average system usability and user experience. By probing into these varied environments, our study offers a comprehensive understanding of the applicability of such collaborative cross-reality systems in real scenarios, potentially fostering more immersive, efficient, and enriching multi-field applications of cross-reality technologies.
