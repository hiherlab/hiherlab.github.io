# Memory VR
![Memory VR](project_pictures/MemoryVR.png)

## Abstract
We present MemoryVR, a virtual museum system designed to preserve and share personal memories. This system enables users to create customized virtual museums within a spatial enclosure, providing an immersive and enriched way to experience personal memories. We invited participants to use MemoryVR to create their own personal virtual museums and visit those created by others. Results from evaluation studies showed a positive impact of Memory VR on their experience of memories. Participants reported that their experiences within the personal virtual museums were fulfilling, invoking a sense of ritual, ownership, curiosity, and engagement.
